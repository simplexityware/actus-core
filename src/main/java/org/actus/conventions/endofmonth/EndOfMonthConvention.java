/**
 * Component that represents a certain end of month day convention
 * <p>
 * Different conventions of how to handle the situation when creating a {@link ContractEvent}
 * date schedule (cf. {@link ScheduleFactory}) starting at an end-of-month day exist. E.g. if
 * the start date of the schedule falls on the 30st of April, do we really mean to create a
 * schedule of dates of the 30st of each month or do we mean to use the last day in each
 * month.
 * <p>
 * Note that the end of month convention only applies to date schedules created using a 
 * {@code 1M}-cycle or a multiple thereof. In particular, any cycle with period unit 
 * {@code D} or {@code W} is not considered a multiple of {@code 1M} (even if it is 
 * {@code 4W}) while any cycle with period unit {@code M}, {@code Q}, {@code H}, and
 * {@code Y} is considered a multiple.
 * <p>
 * Make sure, new conventions implement this interface when adding to the library.
