/**
 * A representation of an external Risk Factor Observer
 * <p>
 * Generally, the payoff of financial instruments is evaluated in the context of an environment that
 * embodies the dynamics (and therewith future states) of all relevant stochastic risk factors - or what
 * we call the Risk Factor Observer. Thus, method {@code ContractType.lifecycle} produces
 * a series of Risk Factor state contingent {@link ContractEvent}s. An external {@code RiskFactorModelProvider} 
 * implements this dynamics and allows to retrieve the state of all defined risk factors identified
 * through a unique {@code id} at any future time.
 * <p>
 * Note, all sorts of external variables on which the payoff of a {@link ContractType} is conditioned
 * must be implemented in the {@code RiskFactorModelProvider}. In particular, any source of market risk,
 * credit risk, or behavioral risk needs to be represented therein and identifiable through a unique ID.
 * Examples of such risk factors are the reference market rate linked to through contract attribute
 * {@code MarketObjectCodeOfRateReset}, the default indicator of a legal entity linked to e.g. through
 * attribute {@code LegalEntityIDCounterparty}, or the market value of an underlying linked to through
 * attribute {@code ContractID} of the underlying.
 * <p>
