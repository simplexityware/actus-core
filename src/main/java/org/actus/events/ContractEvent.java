/**
 * Component that provides a data structure for a single event generated during the lifetime of a
 * {@link ContractType}
 * <p>
 * Contract events represent the atomic analytical elements comprising all events that possibly
 * occur during the lifetime of a {@link ContractType}. That is, contract events mark specific
 * times at which either a state transition, a payoff, or both is generated from a 
 * {@link ContractType}. 
 * <p>
 * Contract events are a generic representation of a specific {@link StateTransitionFunction} and
 * {@link PayOffFunction} with an event time according to which all events in a contract are ordered
 * (in an {@link EventSeries}) and processed sequentially. Thereby, processing an event in fact
 * means that its {@link StateTransitionFunction} and {@link PayOffFunction} are evaluated.
